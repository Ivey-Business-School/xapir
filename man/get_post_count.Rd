get_post_count(
  query,
  end_time = NULL,
  start_time = NULL,
  granularity = "hour",

  since_id = NULL,
  pagination_token = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{query}{The search to be made on X. You can find ways to build specific queries according to the \href{https://docs.x.com/x-api/posts/search/integrate/build-a-query#types}{X API documentation website}}

\item{end_time}{The latest date-time from which you want to get posts.
Provide the value in ISO 8601 format (i.e., \code{YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ}). The
\code{iso_8601()} function will convert a string, date, or date-time object to
the required format (e.g., \code{iso_8601("2024-10-10")}).}

\item{start_time}{The earliest date-time from which you want to get posts.}

\item{granularity}{The granularity for the search counts results. This takes either the value 'minute', 'hour', or 'day'.}

\item{until_id}{A post ID to limit the results to posts older than the
specified ID.}

\item{since_id}{A post ID to limit the results to posts more recent than the
specified ID.}

\item{pagination_token}{A string used to navigate backward through result
pages. The X API provides this token when more results are available.
Typically, you wonâ€™t need to set this manually as the function handles it,
but you can supply a pagination_token from a previous response to continue
retrieving results beyond the last page, if desired.}

\item{sleep_time}{A numeric value specifying the number of seconds to wait
between API calls. This helps avoid hitting rate limits imposed by the X
API. You can adjust this value based on your tier's rate limits, which are
detailed on the \href{https://developer.x.com/en/docs/rate-limits}{X API documentation website}.}

\item{bearer_token}{A string containing the bearer token for authenticating
with the X API. By default, this argument retrieves the token from the
environment variable \code{X_BEARER_TOKEN} (via \code{Sys.getenv("X_BEARER_TOKEN")}).
Adding your bearer token to your \code{.Renviron} file ensures it is securely
stored and accessible without needing to manually input it for each
session.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} containing the four elements that make up the API
response
}
\description{
Retrieve the number of recent posts (tweet counts) for a given query. This endpoint provides
counts over the last 7 days, and allows for aggregation by minute, hour, or day.
