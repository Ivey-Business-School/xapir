{xapir} is an R package that connects to a limited set of X API v2 endpoints using 
tidy principles.  

Package features include: 

  * OAuth 2.0 authentication by setting your API token as environment variable (Bearer Token)
  * Retrieve a user's timeline data using `get_timeline()`
  * Search for posts with keywords using `search_recent_posts()`
  * Extract post data using `extract_post()`
  * Extract user data using `extract_user()`

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# get the development version on GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Ivey-Business-School/xapir")

# this package is NOT on CRAN so you cannot install using `install.packages()`
```

If you encounter an issue while using this package, please file a minimal reproducible 
example on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ivey-Business-School/xapir/issues).

## Vignettes

The README below outlines the basic package functionality. For more information 
please feel free to browse the {xapir} website at https://Ivey-Business-School.github.io/xapir/ which contains the following vignettes:

  * [Getting Started](https://Ivey-Business-School.github.io/xapir/articles/getting-started.html)

## Usage

### Authenticate
First, initialize your X token for future use. 

```{r init, eval = FALSE}
library(usethis)

# Once the renviron file open, paste your bearer token as <X_BEARER_TOKEN = "">, then restart R
edit_r_environ()
```

From here, you can load the packages required. 

```{r auth, eval = FALSE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(dplyr)))
library(xapir)
```

After supplying your token and loading the package, you can begin running functions that call the X APIs.

### Get Timeline

`get_timeline()` allows for the timeline of an account to be extracted through the X API. The following 
example uses the function to extract all posts from Tesla between January 1, 2025 to January 31, 2025. 

```{r get-timeline, eval = FALSE}
response <- get_timeline(
  username = "Tesla",
  max_results = 100,
  start_time = iso_8601("2025-01-01"), 
  end_time = iso_8601("2025-01-31"),
)
```

### Search Recent Posts

`search_recent_posts()` allows for the user to search for posts using a query within the last 7 days. The 
following example uses the function to extract posts related to weddings and are not retweets nor replies.

``` {r search-recent-posts, eval = FALSE} 
response <- search_recent_posts{
  query = "weddings -is:retweet -is:reply"
}
```

### Extract Posts

`extract_post()` uses the results from the API call and cleans the data to return a tibble of all tweets. 

```{r extract-post, eval = FALSE}
posts <- extract_post(
  timeline = response
)
```

### Extract Users

`extract_user()` uses the results from the API call and cleans the data to return a tibble of all users. 
This includes accounts whose tweets were retweeted by the targeted account. 

```{r extract-user, eval = FALSE}
users <-  extract_user(
  timeline = response
)
```

## Future

This package only contains functions that use a subset of the X API endpoints.
Future iterations may expand upon this to include more.

## More Information

X provides examples in many programming languages, including R by using the 
package {RTwitterV2}. Please use the X API documentation for more detail around
what is expected for each endpoint and the type of data the API call will return. 
X's documentation is available here: https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api.
